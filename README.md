Although there are a lot of news apps that are popular around the world, most of them have too much functionalities and sometimes it is hard to use specially for users who are not familiar with a mobile app. Therefore I developed a mobile app which is simple to use.

- able to see the updated articles
- load more articles when users scoll down
- able to choose a common keyword such as health, technologies and sports
- able to search with free keyword in any languages
- sharing function via SNS
- able to save articles using local storage.
- able to open by a browser


## Result & Conclusion
This app was published in App Store for a year and almost 10 users have downloaded this app.
